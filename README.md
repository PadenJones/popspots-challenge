#### Popspots Challenge

A quick implementation of the Popspots Challenge.

* Frontend: React, Material-UI, Mapbox, and Google Maps API
* Backend: Node.js, Express
* DB: no database

I left the backend directory structure pretty sparse due 
to the lack of API calls, they're all in one file. If the project
were any bigger I'd separate things into subdirectories.

I opted out of a database for the sake of dev speed, in a 
professional setting I would definitely expect to have one.
