#### Popspots Challenge

[https://popspots-challenge.herokuapp.com/](https://popspots-challenge.herokuapp.com/)

A code challenge I completed for an interview. This application allows users to find advertising locations
near a given location, sorted by distance from that location. The application interfaces with the Google Maps API
to grab valid addresses for user auto-complete. The advertising locations get retrieved from a REST API, sorted on 
the backend, then displayed to the user on a Mapbox map.

* Frontend: React, Material-UI, Mapbox, and Google Maps API
* Backend: Node.js, Express
* DB: no database
